# Contributor Code of Conduct

For you, brethren, have been called to liberty; only do not use liberty as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” But if you bite and devour one another, beware lest you be consumed by one another! - [Galatians 5:13-15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gal.5.13-Gal.5.15&version=NKJV)
